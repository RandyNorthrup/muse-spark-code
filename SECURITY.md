# Security policy

Muse Spark Code (Unofficial) runs a coding agent inside VS Code: it reads
and edits files in your workspace, runs shell commands with your approval,
and sends your prompts to Meta. Security problems in that surface are taken
seriously and fixed first.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.

- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository:
  **Security → Report a vulnerability** at
  https://github.com/RandyNorthrup/muse-spark-code/security/advisories/new.
- Include the extension version (`Muse Spark: Diagnostics` in the Command
  Palette writes the versions and the configuration facts to the log; it
  contains no credentials), the steps to reproduce, and what an attacker
  gains.

You will get an acknowledgement within seven days. A confirmed
vulnerability is fixed in a patch release and credited in the changelog
unless you prefer otherwise.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release on the Visual Studio Marketplace receives fixes.

## What the extension protects, and how

- **Credentials.** A pasted Model API key lives only in VS Code's
  SecretStorage, is sent only to `api.meta.ai`, and is never passed to a
  child process, written to settings or logs, or shown in the panel. The
  Muse Code CLI's own sign-in is never read (only the presence of its
  credential file). The log channel redacts key-shaped strings.
- **Workspace trust.** In VS Code's Restricted Mode the agent loads no
  workspace rules, skills or memory and runs no shell commands. The settings
  that choose what runs and what is billed (`museBinaryPath`,
  `environmentVariables`, `backend`, `shellSandbox`, `initialPermissionMode`,
  `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions`) are machine-scoped in every workspace,
  trusted or not: a repository's `.vscode/settings.json` cannot point the
  extension at its own executable.
- **Shell commands.** On the Model API backend the extension's own shell
  tool runs the command as an argument array through PowerShell or bash,
  never as a shell string, in the workspace root, with a timeout and an
  output cap, and only after the user's approval in the modes that ask. On
  the Muse Code CLI backend the CLI runs the commands inside its OS sandbox
  where that is set up; `museSpark.shellSandbox` at `auto` starts the CLI
  without the sandbox for a Windows workspace under the user's profile
  (where the sandbox cannot enter), and `off` never sandboxes; both leave
  the approval cards in place.
- **Files.** Every path the model gives a tool is confined to the workspace
  root; escapes are refused.
- **Webview.** `default-src 'none'`, a per-load script nonce, no remote
  origins, no inline styles; every message between the host and the
  webview is validated against a schema.
- **Prompt injection.** Workspace files, rules and skills reach the model by
  design in a trusted workspace; the permission modes and the approval
  cards are the control, and the Diagnostics report and the log show what
  ran.
