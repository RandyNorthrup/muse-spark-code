# Catch burn-down list (D119)

Every site the corrected catch classifier accepts lives in
`scripts/catch-baseline.json` (1,347 identities after PR161FIN: 1,163 from
the original reader plus the corrected reader's pre-existing finds, minus
the sites PR161FIN fixed). New sites still fail `npm run check:catches`.
Fix an area by fixing its handlers (the failure reaches the person in
words or the caller as an error with its cause), proving the test fires,
then regenerating the lowered baseline with
`node scripts/catch-inventory.mjs --write-baseline`. Never weaken the
classifier, its tests or the gate.

Areas PR161FIN fixed outright (money, credentials, consent and their
chains) carry no baseline debt for the handlers they repaired; the two
residual flags below rejoin the baseline with their reasons.

Designed baselines with reasons (accepted, not forgotten):

- `src/core/schedules/scheduler.ts` fire catch: settled recovery resolves
  on the proven settlement (the send error is superseded by proof); every
  failed or ambiguous round is journaled first, then rejects.
- `src/runtime/schedules/nodeScheduleFs.ts` publish catch: a matching
  staged read proves the publication moot; every other path names its
  condition or rethrows.
- `src/runtime/schedules/channel.ts`, `ScheduleEditor.tsx`,
  `ScheduleSurface.tsx`: fixed user words by l10n law; the channel keeps
  the send failure as its cause.
- `src/acp/accounts.ts` (3): fixed protocol vocabulary; the refused
  providers file keeps `providersInvalid`, the panel renders words for
  every code.
- `src/acp/vault.ts` ask: fail-closed deny; only a validated answer or a
  deny crosses.
- `src/acp/questionDeferral.ts` (4 GENERIC): the form closes, the failed
  marker is the record, safe defaults return. Note for a later lane: the
  person hears no failure words when a deferral dies silently (APP PROBLEM).
- `src/runtime/chatGptProviderCommands.ts` verify + outer command catch:
  fixed CLI words and exit codes; known sign-in codes are kept.
- `src/host/vault/slots/windowsVaultBuild.ts`: unsafe parents fall back
  to the temp tree with the host report signal.
- `src/runtime/vault/slots/macVaultProtocol.ts`: only the validated fixed
  error class crosses the broker boundary; raw diagnostics stay local.
- `src/host/auth/authService.ts` sign-in restart, `src/core/developer`
  multi-account start/enable, `src/runtime/chatGptProviderCommands.ts`
  setup: fixed in PR161FIN (named closers, kind words, cause slots).
- `src/runtime/estimator/command.ts` run catch (CATCHRUN2): the outer CLI
  floor. Inner layers already classify refusals with their own detail
  (`isEstimateRefusal` in session and ACP); the floor reports residue in
  fixed translated words with explicit exit 1. The cause cannot enter the
  sentence (rule 18) and the port offers no record channel; rethrowing
  would replace an explicit exit with a crash. Evidence:
  `test/unit/runtimeCatchHandlers.test.ts` "estimate command floor" (a
  real contract failure through the runner port exits 1 with fixed words
  and nothing written) plus the `estimateSession` refusal/foreign-failure
  tests.
- `src/runtime/playbook/command.ts` run catch (CATCHRUN2): "Output
  contains validated data only, never exception text" is the documented
  contract; `runPlaybookCli` maps `ok:false` onto stderr and exit 1, and
  a hostile port's malformed data parses to the same fixed refusal.
  Rethrowing would crash the CLI past its explicit failure exit.
  Evidence: `test/unit/runtimeCatchHandlers.test.ts` "playbook command
  floor" (a failing port read answers `ok:false` with
  `playbookCommandFailed` and no leak).
- `src/runtime/fonts/nodeInstall.ts` probe catch (CATCHRUN2): every probe
  failure (absent, unreadable, invalid) maps onto the safe action, a
  fresh publication; publication owns its failures with causes. Naming
  the installer's own refusal would need locale-coupled message matching.
  Evidence: `test/unit/runtimeCatchHandlers.test.ts` "font pack
  publication" (fresh publish, matching reuse, refused clobber with the
  old bytes intact).
- `src/runtime/fonts/nodeInstall.ts` publish catch (CATCHRUN2): mirrors
  the accepted schedule publish entry above — a matching pack proves a
  concurrent publication moot; a mismatched one rethrows without touching
  the file. Evidence: "settles concurrent publishers on one destination"
  (two real concurrent publishers, one destination) and the
  refused-clobber case.
- `src/runtime/providers/accountsCommand.ts` both command catches
  (CATCHRUN2): the outer CLI boundary prints the reviewed `commandError`
  vocabulary (fixed sentences per store code; kept-cause messages
  otherwise, as `test/unit/accountErrorTruth.test.ts` pins, including a
  real unreadable-file failure) with explicit exit 1. Inlining the
  vocabulary into the handlers would duplicate it and diverge; rethrowing
  would crash past the explicit exit. No record channel in deps.
- Everything else below: pre-existing, grouped for area-by-area lanes.
