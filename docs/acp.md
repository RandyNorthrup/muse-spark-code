# Muse Spark in other editors (ACP)

`muse-spark-code-acp` runs Muse Spark as an agent in any editor that speaks
the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com): Zed, the
JetBrains IDEs through AI Assistant, Xcode 27, Qt Creator, Neovim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Devin Desktop and others. The editor shows the chat, the tool
calls, the plan and the permission prompts; the agent runs Muse Code (or
the Meta Model API) the way the VS Code panel does. It is unofficial and not
endorsed by Meta.

The configuration below names the command and its arguments. Where each
editor keeps its agent settings is in that editor's documentation, linked
from [the compatibility plan](ide-compatibility.md#32-ides-and-editors-reached-through-a-shared-acp-agent);
[hosts.md](ide-compatibility/hosts.md) records which editors have been
tested, at which version, and what was found.

## Install

Node.js 22 or later is required.

- From a GitHub Release, by the package's URL:

  ```sh
  npm install -g https://github.com/RandyNorthrup/muse-spark-code/releases/download/v<version>/muse-spark-code-acp-<version>.tgz
  ```

  or download `muse-spark-code-acp-<version>.tgz` and run
  `npm install -g ./muse-spark-code-acp-<version>.tgz`.

- From npm, once the first release is published there:
  `npm install -g muse-spark-code-acp`.

`muse-spark-code-acp --version` confirms the install.

On Windows, npm installs the command as a `.cmd` launcher, which some
editors cannot start. If the editor reports that it cannot find or start
`muse-spark-code-acp`, give it `node` as the command and the agent's
script as the first argument, before the others:
`node "<npm root -g>\muse-spark-code-acp\dist\acp.js"`, where
`<npm root -g>` is the folder `npm root -g` prints (usually
`%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules`). The same form works on every platform.

## Choose who pays

The agent runs on one backend, chosen when the editor starts it; it never
switches on its own.

| Backend                             | Arguments            | Who pays                     | Needs                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Muse Code (the default)             | (none)               | Your Muse Code subscription  | The Muse Code CLI, signed in                             |
| Meta Model API (bring your own key) | `--backend modelApi` | Your Model API key, per call | A key stored with `muse-spark-code-acp auth set` (below) |

Configure two agents in the editor if you want both.

## Sign in

Editors that run sign-ins in a terminal offer the right one when the agent
asks for it. Elsewhere, run it yourself once:

- **Muse Code**: `muse-spark-code-acp login` runs Muse Code's own sign-in.
- **Model API key**: `muse-spark-code-acp auth set` asks for the key without
  showing it and keeps it in the operating system's credential store:
  Windows Credential Manager, the macOS Keychain, or on Linux the Secret
  Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, KeePassXC). `auth status` says whether
  one is stored; `auth clear` removes it.

The key is never read from an environment variable, a settings file or an
argument, and never passed to Muse Code. On Linux without a running,
unlocked Secret Service the Model API backend is unavailable; there is no
plaintext fallback.

## Configure the editor

Every editor needs the same two things: the command,
`muse-spark-code-acp`, and the arguments. The configurations below were
tested with the editor versions they name; check each editor's current
documentation if the format has moved on.

In Zed (tested with 1.20.2), a custom agent goes in `settings.json`; it
then appears under External Agents in the Agent Panel's new-thread menu:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Muse Spark": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "muse-spark-code-acp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

In Emacs, [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) takes an
agent configuration; this one was tested with agent-shell 0.79.2 and
Emacs 29.3 (add `"--backend" "modelApi"` to the arguments for the other
backend):

```elisp
(require 'agent-shell)

(defun muse-spark-agent-config ()
  (agent-shell-make-agent-config
   :identifier 'muse-spark
   :mode-line-name "Muse Spark"
   :buffer-name "Muse Spark"
   :shell-prompt "Muse> "
   :shell-prompt-regexp "Muse> "
   :client-maker (lambda (buffer)
                   (acp-make-client :command "muse-spark-code-acp"
                                    :command-params '()
                                    :context-buffer buffer))))

(defun muse-spark ()
  "Start a Muse Spark shell."
  (interactive)
  (agent-shell-start :config (muse-spark-agent-config)))
```

`M-x muse-spark` opens the shell; a permission prompt takes `y` to allow
once and `C-c C-c` to reject (which also stops the turn).

In Neovim, [CodeCompanion](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim)
takes an ACP adapter; this one was tested with CodeCompanion v19.25.0 and
Neovim 0.11.4:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    acp = {
      muse_spark = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("goose", {
          name = "muse_spark",
          formatted_name = "Muse Spark",
          commands = { default = { "muse-spark-code-acp" } },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
  interactions = { chat = { adapter = "muse_spark" } },
})
```

`:CodeCompanionChat` opens a chat; a permission prompt lists its keys
(Accept, Reject, Cancel) in the chat buffer.

In JupyterLab 4, [Jupyter AI](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai) 3
(`pip install jupyter-ai`; tested with 3.2.0 and JupyterLab 4.6.3) runs
ACP agents as chat personas. Save this as
`.jupyter/personas/muse_spark_persona.py` in the folder JupyterLab serves
(the file name must contain `persona`), with any square SVG beside it as
`muse_spark.svg`, then open a new chat and pick Muse Spark:

```python
import os

from jupyter_ai_acp_client.base_acp_persona import BaseAcpPersona
from jupyter_ai_persona_manager import PersonaDefaults


class MuseSparkAcpPersona(BaseAcpPersona):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, executable=["muse-spark-code-acp"], **kwargs)

    @property
    def defaults(self) -> PersonaDefaults:
        return PersonaDefaults(
            name="Muse Spark",
            description="Muse Spark Code (Unofficial) through its ACP agent.",
            avatar_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "muse_spark.svg"),
            system_prompt="unused",
        )
```

Jupyter AI offers the agent its notebook tools as an MCP server, which
the agent passes to Muse Code (below).

Other editors take the same command and arguments in their own agent or
ACP settings (JetBrains AI Assistant, Xcode's Intelligence settings, Qt
Creator's ACP Client, sublime-acp, Devin Desktop's custom agents).

## Options

| Argument                               | Effect                                                                                                                  |

| `--trust-workspace`                    | Load the folder's rules, skills and memory, as Muse Code's own flag does. Without it the folder is treated as untrusted |
| `--muse-binary <path>`                 | The Muse Code CLI to run; by default the agent looks where the VS Code extension looks                                  |
| `--shell-sandbox auto\|muse\|off`      | Muse Code's shell sandbox, as the extension's `museSpark.shellSandbox` setting                                          |
| `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` | Offer the Bypass permissions mode                                                                                       |
| `--allow-contributor-models`           | List contributor-tier models, whose content Meta may train on; they are hidden otherwise                                |
| `--web-search`                         | Offer paid web search (Model API backend only), once you accept its price in the editor                                 |
| `--image-generation`                   | Offer paid image generation (Model API backend only), once you accept its price in the editor                           |
| `--verbose`                            | Log every detail to stderr (the editor's agent log)                                                                     |

## What the editor sees

- **Modes**: Manual, Edit automatically, Plan, Auto (and Bypass permissions
  with its flag), as in the panel.
- **Settings**: the model and the reasoning effort.
- **Commands**: the session's skills, run as `/name arguments`.
- **Permission prompts**: the backend's own choices (allow once, allow for
  the session, reject). A prompt the editor cancels, or answers with a
  choice it was not offered, is rejected; nothing runs by default.
- **Questions** the agent asks: a form where the editor has forms,
  otherwise the question as text, answered in your next message.
- **Sessions**: listed, loaded with their history, resumed and closed.
- **Prompts**: text, files as @mentions, attached excerpts, and PNG, JPEG,
  GIF and WebP images up to 10 MB.
- **MCP servers** the editor offers (Zed's context servers, Jupyter AI's
  notebook tools): passed to Muse Code for the session, over stdio or
  HTTP, and optional, so one that fails to start does not stop the
  session. SSE servers are not taken; the Model API backend runs none.

## Paid features

Web search ($2.50 per 1,000 searches) and image generation ($0.01 per
image) cost money on top of tokens and are billed to your Model API key.
They are off unless the editor starts the agent with `--web-search` or
`--image-generation` (with `--backend modelApi`). Then the first prompt
asks, in the editor, whether to turn each on, naming what it does and
its price; only "Turn on" does. The answer holds until the agent stops;
"Keep off", a cancelled question or an editor that cannot ask leaves the
feature off and it is not asked again. Every image is still asked for
one by one, and every paid row and approval names its price. The agent
log counts each billed use. Muse Voice needs the VS Code panel's
microphone, so the agent has none.

## Not yet

- The Model API backend reads and writes files itself, so it does not see
  unsaved changes in the editor; save before asking it to edit a file you
  have open.
- MCP servers on the Model API backend.
