# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Entries record what actually
happened, not what was planned; superseded entries are kept.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs and npm given a minimum release
  age of 3 days, both raised as blocking findings by the semgrep CI job.

### Added

- Project scaffold (milestone M0): TypeScript 6.0.3 extension host + React 19
  webview bundled with esbuild; strict type-checked ESLint 10 (typescript-eslint
  `strictTypeChecked`, unicorn, react-hooks), Prettier, stylelint, knip, dpdm,
  jscpd, vitest with coverage thresholds, `@vscode/test-cli` integration tests,
  gitleaks, npm audit, husky + lint-staged pre-commit, GitHub Actions CI
  (ubuntu + windows quality matrix, gitleaks, semgrep).
- Minimal extension: `Muse Spark` activity-bar container with a `Chat` webview
  view, `Muse Spark: Open in New Tab` and `Muse Spark: Open in Sidebar`
  commands, nonce-based CSP, zod-validated host/webview message contract, and
  an empty-state shell ("Type /model to pick the right tool for the job.").
- `docs/certification/m0.md`: every gate run on the scaffold and proven to fail
  on a deliberate break. Findings: `knip --strict` analysed nothing (strict
  implies production mode, which needs `!` entries) so the gate is plain `knip`;
  the integration tab test polls `tabGroups` instead of reading it synchronously;
  `npm audit` high in the dev-only mocha chain resolved with `overrides`.
- `PLAN.md` with research notes (Meta Model API, Muse Code SDK / MSP, Claude
  Code extension parity inventory), architecture, decisions, and milestones
  M0–M8.
